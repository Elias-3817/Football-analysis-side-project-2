# Football Analysis Side Project

## Overview
In modern football, traditional positional roles have evolved significantly. A player may be listed as an attacking midfielder in a starting XI but perform a role entirely different from the classic number 10. Others may start out wide but drift centrally, functioning more like an attacking midfielder. Similarly, fullbacks now operate in diverse roles—acting as third center-backs in buildup, shifting into midfield as inverted fullbacks, or pushing high as auxiliary wingers.

Given these positional fluidities, this project examines Subjective Offensive Midfielders—players whose roles align with attacking midfield responsibilities, regardless of their listed positions. To create this dataset, I manually reviewed heatmaps of multiple players across different teams to determine if they fit this category. Once identified, I analyzed their statistical outputs, with a particular focus on Curtis Jones and other Liverpool midfielders, to assess their strengths and areas of influence.

This repository contains data analyses for evaluating these subjective offensive midfielders in football. The project utilizes various statistical metrics to assess player performance across multiple aspects of the game.
