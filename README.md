# Football-analysis-side-project-2
My aim is to analyze premier league offensive minded midfielders and or players that may tick the label offensive minded 'midfielder' role regardless of the role they are assigned in a match (i.e fullbacks operating as falsebacks, wingers operating as inverted playmakers e.t.c.)Mostly interested in Liverpool players.
